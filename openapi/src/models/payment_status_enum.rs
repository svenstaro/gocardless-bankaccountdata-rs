/// PaymentStatusEnum : * `INIT` - Initiated. Payment has been initiated. * `ERRE` - ExecutionError. We experienced error on payment execution. * `ERRS` - StatusError. We experienced error retrieving payment status. Try again. * `ACCC` - AcceptedSettlementCompleted. Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed * `ACCP` - AcceptedCustomerProfile. Preceding check of technical validation was successful. Customer profile check was successful * `ACSC` - AcceptedSettlementCompleted. Settlement on the debtor’s account has been completed * `ACSP` - AcceptedSettlementInProcess. All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution * `ACTC` - AcceptedTechnicalValidation. Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful * `ACWC` - AcceptedWithChange. Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent * `ACWP` - AcceptedWithoutPosting. Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customer’s account * `RCVD` - Received. Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent * `PDNG` - Pending. Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. Further checks and status update will be performed * `RJCT` - Rejected. Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected. * `CANC` - Cancelled. Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution * `ACFC` - AcceptedFundsChecked. Pre-ceeding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive * `PATC` - PartiallyAcceptedTechnicalCorrect. The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed * `PART` - PartiallyAccepted. A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status
